// TODO: implement service worker so that users can use the app offline. The SW
// will need to cache static assets to display the app offline. Additionally,
// the SW should cache transaction data, using the cached data as a fallback
// when the app is used offline. HINT: You should use two caches. One for the
// static assets such ass html, css, js, images, etc; and another cache for
// the dynamic data from requests to routes beginning with "/api".
